spec for multiblind:
- click MBLD
- enter num cubes by using +/- btns. remembers last input in localstorage.
- click "begin"
- controls at top disappear and are replaced with numbers for cubes
- you can cycle thru cubes and memo them
- once done, click "done"
- enter all your memos, click "done" (TODO mockup)
- click "check" on each one-by-one. (TODO mockup)
  - BMT will pop up
  - you can then mark whether it was a success or failure
  - todo: can i automate this? (will CORS let me?) or port BMT to js?
- once you've checked which are DNFs, review DNFs & check why you DNFed (TODO mockup)
